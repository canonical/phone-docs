# Customization and branding

Scopes come in a very flexible customization package where you can add your brand’s identity through colors, logos and arranging cards and categories.

##Header and background

The header allows for the most customization, as you can change the color of the background, insert your own branded logo, or use different text colors and fonts.

We provide a set of several elements that you can use to change the look of your scope header, background and text color.

##Standard header

##Category and card design

The templates define how result cards are laid out within a category, where you are free to use your own layout and rendering style using a template declared in your scope code; but there are rules.
